# Typed Partial Test Fixtures in TypeScript

Read when a TypeScript test needs only a few properties of a large object, or needs intentionally wrong data, and the test file uses `as` type assertions to make the compiler accept it. The pattern uses `@total-typescript/shoehorn`.

## Why replace `as` in tests

`shoehorn` lets you pass partial data in tests while keeping TypeScript happy. It replaces `as` assertions with type-safe alternatives.

**Test code only.** Never use shoehorn in production code.

Problems with `as` in tests:

- Developers are trained not to use it
- You must manually specify the target type
- Intentionally wrong data needs a double assertion (`as unknown as Type`)

Partial fixtures support the behavior-test rules in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md): build only the inputs the behavior under test reads, so the test states what matters and nothing else.

## Install

Add the dependency only when the change is in scope and the project uses npm-compatible tooling. Use the project's package manager.

```bash
npm i @total-typescript/shoehorn
```

## Migration patterns

### Large objects with few needed properties

Before:

```ts
type Request = {
  body: { id: string };
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  cookies: Record<string, string>;
  // ...20 more properties
};

it("gets user by id", () => {
  // Only care about body.id but must fake entire Request
  getUser({
    body: { id: "123" },
    headers: {},
    cookies: {},
    // ...fake all 20 properties
  });
});
```

After:

```ts
import { fromPartial } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

it("gets user by id", () => {
  getUser(
    fromPartial({
      body: { id: "123" },
    }),
  );
});
```

### `as Type` to `fromPartial()`

Before:

```ts
getUser({ body: { id: "123" } } as Request);
```

After:

```ts
import { fromPartial } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

getUser(fromPartial({ body: { id: "123" } }));
```

### `as unknown as Type` to `fromAny()`

Before:

```ts
getUser({ body: { id: 123 } } as unknown as Request); // wrong type on purpose
```

After:

```ts
import { fromAny } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

getUser(fromAny({ body: { id: 123 } }));
```

## When to use each

| Function        | Use case                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `fromPartial()` | Pass partial data that still type-checks           |
| `fromAny()`     | Pass intentionally wrong data (keeps autocomplete) |
| `fromExact()`   | Force full object (swap with fromPartial later)    |

## Workflow

1. **Gather requirements.** Establish from the request, or ask the user when it is not observable:
   - Which test files have `as` assertions causing problems?
   - Are they dealing with large objects where only some properties matter?
   - Do they need to pass intentionally wrong data for error testing?

2. **Install and migrate**:
   - [ ] Install: `npm i @total-typescript/shoehorn`
   - [ ] Find test files with `as` assertions: `grep -r " as [A-Z]" --include="*.test.ts" --include="*.spec.ts"`
   - [ ] Replace `as Type` with `fromPartial()`
   - [ ] Replace `as unknown as Type` with `fromAny()`
   - [ ] Add imports from `@total-typescript/shoehorn`
   - [ ] Run type check to verify

A fixture migration is a behavior-preserving test change: run the affected tests before and after and confirm the same results. It does not need new failing tests.
